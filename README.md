Motivation 

As students, we have firsthand experience of how difficult and stressful it can be to juggle academic workload while maintaining a positive mental health state. While the obvious answer to excellent academic performance is more consistent and rigorous studying, it should not have to come at the expense of our mental state and happiness. Now, if only there was a way to be efficient in planning out our project meetings and due assignments while also leaving ourselves with ample breathing room in order to not get burnt out. Therefore, we decided on an idea for students to have meaningful exchanges with our chatbot that will aid them in properly planning their time, and at the same time acting as a mental well-being assistant by providing advice should one prompt it to do so.


Aim 

MindfulStudy is an AI-powered chatbot that helps students improve study habits and manage mental well-being. It offers personalized study plans, time management tips, and mindfulness exercises to support productivity and reduce stress.
